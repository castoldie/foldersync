# Foldersync

Hello everyone! Foldersync is a very simple synchronization tool that takes the status of a source folder and clones it onto a destination folder, regularly every given time.

## Installation

To install the package, first clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/castoldie/foldersync.git`

Then to install Foldersync is as easy as running:

`make install`

## Usage

### To start the synchronization process you have 2 options:

1 - You can manually start the program by running in your terminal:
    
`folder_sync /path/to/source /path/to/replica 3600 /path/to/log.txt`
    
this will synchronize the `/path/to/source` folder with the `/path/to/replica` folder every 3600 seconds (1 hour), and log the file operations to `/path/to/log.txt`.

2 - You can simply run, always in your terminal while in the root of your repoÂ´s local directory:

`make test`
    
this will run the same command as in the previous point, but pointing the test_X folders contained in this repo, syncing every 10 seconds, so you can see by yourself the behaviour of this app without waiting as much.

## Note:

In order to avoid making the repo too heavy, i made a test run with files of my own, then removed them from source. You can see the output of this operation in `logs/log_old.txt`
